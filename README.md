# string-tension
A program to calculate the tensions of guitar or bass strings.

### Running the program
Run `./string-tension` to execute the program. You can modify any of the string parameters (length, gauge, type, note, and octave) to re-calculate tension. You can reset any modifications made, or switch to a bass preset by using the "Presets" choice widget.

You can also read more detailed usage of the program by pressing `Ctrl + H`, or viewing "Help" in the menu bar at the top of the window.

### Building from source
To build this project, run `make` in the top-level directory. This will create an executable named "string-tension" in the "build" directory. You can run `make test` to create the test executable, which will also appear in the build directory.

Detailed documentation can be generated by running `Doxygen` in the top-level directory.

### Build Requirements
- g++
- Fast Light Toolkit (FLTK)
- Googletest (Optional, only required for testing)
- Doxygen (Optional, used to generate HTML/LaTeX documentation)
